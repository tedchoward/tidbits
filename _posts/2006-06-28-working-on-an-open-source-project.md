The past few weeks have been very interesting at work. It has been frustrating to be without my website because I’ve had many things I wanted to write about. It’s been about two weeks since we released [ThinWire][1] under the [GNU General Public License][2]. Since then, it has been a new experience watching the project slowly grow. Every day we look to see if someone has reviewed it. So far only this [Japanese site][3] has written a review. Since I don’t speak Japanese, and the [Google Translator][4] is less than helpful, we’re not really sure if they like it or not.

This past week, we joined the thousands of open source projects on [SourceForge][5]. We’re now able to accurately track downloads, which are growing by the day. SourceForge does a good job with download mirrors. Their other services are lacking. (I’ll probably have more to say/rant about this later)

This is a new experience for me and for my company. I’ll continue to chronicle the open source journey here. If you haven’t checked out [ThinWire][6], you should go [download][7] it. It has the potential to change the status of web applications.
