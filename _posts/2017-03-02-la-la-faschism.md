L.A. Weekly's April Wolfe
[says La La Land is a propaganda film](http://www.dallasobserver.com/film/la-la-land-is-a-propaganda-film-9216080).
I didn't pick up on any of those points when I saw the film. I actually really
enjoyed it. I'm now thinking about what that says about me and my perspective.
What else am I blind to?
