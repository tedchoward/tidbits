> But in many ways, the thing that cemented Windows XP's status wasn't Windows
> XP itself: it was the lack of any successor. Microsoft's Longhorn project,
> an ambitious plan to radically rework Windows, with an all-new set of APIs
> and a database-like filesystem, was delayed and ultimately abandoned
> entirely. Windows Vista, a massively scaled back, more conservative release,
> eventually arrived in 2006, but by this time Windows XP had become so
> dominant that users, particularly business users, didn't want a new
> operating system. That Windows Vista had trouble in its early days, thanks
> to its steeper hardware demands, its polarizing appearance, and display
> driver issues--mirroring, in many ways, Windows XP's own
> introduction--just served to entrench Windows XP further. Business users
> stuck with Windows XP, and Windows Vista struggled to ever make a serious
> dent in its predecessor's market share, peaking at just 19 percent in the
> final days before Windows 7's release.
