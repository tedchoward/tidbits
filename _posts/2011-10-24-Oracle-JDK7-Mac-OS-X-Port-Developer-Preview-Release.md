This is an important first step in the new world order for Java and Mac
OS X.  Java 7 will be the first Java release for the Mac not released by
Apple.  Once upon a time, the Mac was considered the best platform for
Java.  When Apple announced it would discontinue official support for
Java, many began to question the future of Java on the Mac.

As a Java developer, I hope Oracle will continue to put out a quality
product so that I can continue to make my living on my platform of
choice.
