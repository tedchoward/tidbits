Megan Howard:
> Easter is the holiday where we celebrate the fact that Jesus finished
> the work he came to do, the work that changed the world. But I also
> think there is good reason for Christmas to be the "bigger" holiday.
> It is the holiday of mystery and wonder. The holiday where we
> celebrate not what Jesus has done, but the holiday where we celebrate
> hope for what he could do. The baby Jesus is not a symbol of
> accomplishment, but a symbol of potential, and potential holds a great
> mystery.
