This morning I did a little research on all the Apple themed stories with the purpose of making an educated prediction about what Apple will announce tomorrow at their press event. As I looked into this and discussed the possibilities, I realized that there is no good way to accurately predict what will be announced tomorrow. Therefore, I will lean on the eternal wisdom:

> Even fools are thought wise if they keep silent,  
> and discerning if they hold their tongues.

â€“[Proverbs 17:28][1]

The illusion of my intelligence survives another day!
