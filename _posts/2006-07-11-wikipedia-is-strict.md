In one of my web searches for [ThinWire][1] and Ajax frameworks, I stumbled upon [Wikipedia ][2]articles about some other frameworks. I decided that if these other frameworks deserved articles, then so did ThinWire. In an attempt to get something up there quick, I used the text from our submission to [Ajax Patterns][3]. Within minutes, it had been flagged as a copyright violation. Despite my protests and claims that I authored both the Ajax Patterns and Wikipedia article, it was deleted.

My second attempt involved copying the text from the [ThinWire.com][4] site into an article. This submission was flagged by an editor as advertisement (which is technically true). Today I rewrote the article, making it more objective and less of a sales pitch. I then invited other people to download the framework, and add their more obective analysis to the article. I was reprimanded by the editor again because apparantly original research is not allowed in a Wikipedia article. But [the artcle][5] remains because I qualify as an expert on the subject, and expert writings are allowed. Those guys are strict!
