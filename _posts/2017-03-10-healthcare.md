There seems to be a philosophical disconnect between the two (broadly
generalizing) sides of the health care debate. The technical way to frame the
debats is this: should health care be an entitlement or not? In otherwords,
should it be something everyone deserves to have provided for them, or should it
be something that is sold according to free market rules. I use to be on the
free market side of this debate, but I have since shifted to the entitlement
side. If I were to distill the reason why I changed my mind, it's this: When
someone dies from a medical condition that could have been treated but wasn't
because they couldn't afford the treatment, what is your reaction? If it's,
"well maybe that's not a good thing, but it is fair and just," then that places
you on the free market side of the debate. If, on the other hand, that situation
strikes you as unfair and unjust, then you are on the entitlement side.
