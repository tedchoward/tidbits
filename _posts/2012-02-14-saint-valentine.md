Wikipedia:
> The first representation of Saint Valentine appeared in the [Nurembrg
> Chronicle][1](1943); alongside the woodcut portrait of Valentine, the
> text states that he was a Roman priest martyred during the reign of
> [Claudius II][2], known as Claudius Gothicus. He was arrested and
> imprisoned upon being caught marrying Christian couples and otherwise
> aiding Christians who were at the time being persecuted by Claudius in
> Rome. Helping Christians at this time was considered a crime. Claudius
> took a liking to the prisoner -- until Valentine tried to convert the
> Emperor -- whereupon this priest was condemned to death.

Happy Valentines Day!
