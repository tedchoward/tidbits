It's amazing how one little word can completely change the meaning of a
phrase. It's also amazing how one little phrase can completely shape an
entire theology.

"Faith **in** Christ" implies that we have to do something to attain our
salvation; we must have faith. "Faith **of** Christ" places the burden
on Jesus. It is because of his faithfulness that we are saved. That's a
pretty significant difference.

Words matter, especially the little ones.
