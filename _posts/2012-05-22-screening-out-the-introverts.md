Introversion is definitely not generally respected in our culture
anymore. Some view it as a mental deficiency. This view has permeated
schools, businesses, and even our churches. (How did extroversion become
a sign of spirituality? What about the monastics?)

As a society, we need to value the introvert and look to them for the
insight and wisdom that comes more naturally to someone who is silent
and contemplative.
