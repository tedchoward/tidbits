But he's not really talking about the pledge, he's talking about the
Christian response to war. Within Christianity, you find two opinions of
war. One believes that some wars are just, the other that no war is
just. Logically, if some wars are just then some wars are also unjust,
therefore the "just war" Christians and the "pacifist" Christians should
find themselves united in their oppositions to some wars.
