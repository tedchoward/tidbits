The question just came up at work, do you use one "l" or two when you
spell the past tense of cancel (canceled or cancelled)? It turns out
both are valid, but which one is preferred?

Maeve Maddox at DailyWritingTips says:
> The double l in *cancelled* is British usage; the single l is American
> usage... In American usage, the final l is doubled only when the
> stress falls on a syllable other than the first.
> 
> Where British usage calls for **levelled**, **libelled**,
> **quarrelled**, and **travelled**, American usage has **leveled**,
> **libeled**, **quarreled**, and **traveled**.
> 
> American usage agrees with British on **annulled**, **controlled**,
> **patrolled**, and **extolled** because the stress falls on the second
> syllable of these words.

Confused yet?
