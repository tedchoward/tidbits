I appreciate how he opens up and shares his internal conflict about what
do to when scientific discovery seems to contradict what we read in the
Bible. It can be a scary process to really question things that sit at
the cornerstone of your world view, but I think it is a necessary
endeavor. At the end of the day, I don't want to believe something
because I always have, or because it's comfortable. I want to believe
something because it's true.

That means I can't be afraid to ask questions like this:
> *What if we are wrong in our interpretations of the Bible?*
