The DMN editorial board is
[calling out the Republicans in Austin](http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/2017/03/02/texas-legislature-sets-king-world-power-grabs),
who claim to be for local control, but instead just want to be the ones in
charge. They complain loudly about federal overreach, but then work to take
control away from city and county governments. This particular issue, limiting
the amount a city or county governement can increase the tax rate, is founded
on [bad stastics](http://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas-legislature/2017/01/30/misleading-stats-fuel-republicans-effort-cap-local-property-taxes).

On a side note, I like the new trend of adding a *What you can do* section to
the bottom of their editorials.
