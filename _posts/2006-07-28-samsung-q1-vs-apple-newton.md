Yeah, I know itâ€™s absurd, but I love absurdity. The Samsung Q1 is the first consumer Ultra Mobile PC released. It uses some cutting edge technology developed in a joint venture with Microsoft and Intel. The Newton Messagepad 2000 was released in 1997 by Apple Computer. [Which one will come out ahead][1]?
