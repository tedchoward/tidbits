[OmniNerd][1] has a very [interesting article on our obsession with
finding the cheapest gas available][2].  He mathematically determines
possible savings over a month, and then applies the formulas to other
commodities that we generally aren’t as obsessive at finding better prices.

I have been known to go out of my way for that extra $0.05/gallon savings, but how much am I actually saving?
