Big Tex:
> The State Fair of Texas(R) has selected ***Big and Bright*** as its
> theme for the upcoming 2012 season, which begins Sept. 28 and runs
> through Oct. 21.

Is it too early to start getting excited about the Fair?

> Leading the way will be a Chinese Lantern Festival featuring
> illuminated and animated displays as large as 50 feet high and 300
> feet long while fairgoers visiting Cotton Bowl Plaza will be
> entertained with an all new production of lights and graphics
> displayed on the facade of the historic Cotton Bowl stadium.

205+ days until it opens. I can't wait!!!
