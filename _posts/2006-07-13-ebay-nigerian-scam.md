So, when you sell something on eBay for more than you expect and they want you to ship it to Nigeria, you’re probably being scammed. If you’re still not sure, wait and see if you receive an email from “PayPal” claiming payment has been sent but won’t be posted until the item is shipped. If you get such and email and the grammer is poor, you’re probably being scammed. Still not sure? Read these:

*   [Beware of Fraud][1]
*   [ebay scam?][2]

I have [relisted the item][3] minus the buy it now option. Hopefully we’ll get a legitimate sale this time.
