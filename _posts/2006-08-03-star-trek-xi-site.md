Ok, so they got JJ Abrams to executive produce the next Star Trek Movie.  That’s exciting.  According to IMDB, [Matt Damon][1] is slated to play Captain Kirk.  I’m not sure what to think about that.  Last week, a [teaser poster][2] for the movie was released.  Looks cool.  It’s too bad the movie is 2 years off.  Here’s the [official site][3] for Star Trek XI info.[
