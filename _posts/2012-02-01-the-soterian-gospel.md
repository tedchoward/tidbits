Scot McKnight:
> Instead of having a doxological orientation (how does this bring
> glory to God) or a christological orientation (what does this say
> about Jesus, King and Lord) or a theocentric orientation (how does
> this all reveal God), we too often judge whether something is good by
> asking selfish pragmatics: How does this help me?!
