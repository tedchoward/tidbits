I’ve been putting this off long enough.

I should start blogging again, but:

*   I need to move my blog back to my own domain
*   I need a better style for the blog
*   I need a better defined purpose for the blog
*   I need something to talk about

So it’s time to do something about it. I have moved the blog back to my own server. This should give me the flexibility to do what I want. [WordPress.com][1] is a great free service, but they put a lot of limits on what you are able to do. Example: they restrict the types of content you can embed. [YouTube][2]: yes, [TileStack.com][3] no. That is a big problem for me.

As for the rest of my reasons, I haven’t made any headway there, but I shouldn’t let that stop me. In theory, the content is the reason to visit the site, not the appearance. I can tweak and refine the style of the blog over time, as I continue to blog. I guess that means I’m under construction.

In any case, I’m going to try to post here on a more frequent basis. Some posts will be quick thoughts. Things that catch my eye. Others may be longer, more thought out. (I wouldn’t expect too many of those.) Some may be blatantly promotional for [TileStack.com][3]. (You should sign up for [TileStack.com][3])
