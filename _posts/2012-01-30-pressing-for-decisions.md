Scot McKnight:
> ...twelve ways revivalism's theories of conversion have shaped and
> permeated evangelicalism:
> 
> 1. Conversion is equated with salvation
> 2. There is an emphasis on human choice and decision. It's all about
> the will.
> 3. Conversion is seen as punctiliar, something that happens all at
> once, can be dated and marked and known.
> 4. Revivalism is ambivalent about the intellect and is often
> anti-intellectual.
> 5. Conversion becomes an individual transaction with God, apart from
> the faith community/church.
> 6. Revivalism is ambivalent about or even anti-sacramental. (Including
> baptism.)
> 7. For revivalism, conversion is easy and painless and certainly not
> costly. "Just accept Christ today."
> 8. Among revivalists, evangelism is reduced to techniques.
> 9. Revivalism pushes that God has no grandchildren, but is ambivalent
> about second-generation Christian nurturance into conversion and
> faith.
> 10. Revivalism has at times struggled with connections between
> conversion, baptism and the Holy Spirit.
> 11. The church's mission is to obtain conversions.
> 12. Revivalism focuses on the after-life with minimal reference and
> orientation to this world.
