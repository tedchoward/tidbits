What follows in the post it a list of attributes of the church this
young minister wants to lead. Definitely go read the full thing, but
I'll pick out a few:

> * There is no building, but the foundation is the love of Christ
> * There is no pulpit, but Scripture is opened and taught in living
> rooms, coffee shops, bars and parks
> * Ethnic diversity is the norm
> * No topic off the table for discussion--a "safe place" for any issue
