Conventional wisdom says that the US Postal Service is going broke
because it has an out of date business model, and that it is a waste of
government resources.

Matt Taibbi reports:
> But politics also plays a huge part in this. In 2006, in what looks
> like an attempt to bust the Postal Workers' Union, George Bush signed
> into law the [Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act][1] of 2006. This
> law required the Postal Service to pre-fund 100 percent of its entire
> future obligations for 75 years of health benefits to its employees --
> and not only do it, but do it within ten years. No other organization,
> public or private, has to pre-fund 100 percent of its future health
> benefits.

The impact of this legislation?

> The new law forced the postal service to come up with about $5.5
> billion a year for the ten years following the bill's passage. In
> 2006, before those payments kicked in, the USPS generated a small
> profit. Not surprisingly, the USPS is now basically broke.
