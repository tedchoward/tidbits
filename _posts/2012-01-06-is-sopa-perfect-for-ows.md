Spot on analysis. News has become entertainment. It's almost like
writing historical fiction where you take some facts and build a story
around them. In order to sell the ads, you need to attract the people,
so you create something that will get the people to watch. Find the
facts and build a story around them.

The fact is that new legislation will give the federal government the
power to take over your website at the first complaint of a copyright
holder. No investigation, no due process, no proof. Just a compliant.

This isn't tech startups vs movie studios, it's the federal government
vs our right to free speech. But that's not the story news people want
to tell.
