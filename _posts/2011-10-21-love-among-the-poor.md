Dean Brackley:
> The problem for us is that the new freedoms and economic security have
> distanced the non-poor from the kind of daily life-and-death struggle that
> has been the daily fare of the poor of all times right up to today. Maybe 90
> percent of all the people who ever lived have struggled every day to keep
> the household alive against the threat of death through hunger, disease,
> accidents and violence. By distancing the non-poor from the daily threat of
> death, the benefits of modernity have induced in us a kind of chronic
> lowgrade confusion about what is really important in life, namely life
> itself and love.
