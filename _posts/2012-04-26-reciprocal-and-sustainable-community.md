The Apostle John put it this way:
<figure><blockquote cite="http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=202453836"><p>How
does God's love abide in anyone who has the world's goods and sees a
brother or sister in need and yet refuses help? Little children, let us
love, not in word or speech, but in truth and
action.</p></blockquote><figcaption><cite>[1 John 3:17-18][1]</cite>,
