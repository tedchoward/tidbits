Early last Friday morning, we released the latest version of ThinWire (1.2 Release Candidate 1). Since then, it’s been very interesting and exciting to watch the reaction.

First of all, there actually was a reaction to this release. Nothing of significant note happened after our previous releases, but this one was different.

1.  Our [SourceForge rank][1] has been bouncing all over the place. On Friday night it was 12, Saturday night it fell to 13, Sunday night it rose to 8, and last night it fell back to 12.
2.  Our download count is heathier than ever. We had over 200 on Friday. We exceeded 178 yesterday, and we’re already above 140 this morning.
3.  Other people are talking about us:

It’s all very exciting. For more info, check [thinwire.com][2].
