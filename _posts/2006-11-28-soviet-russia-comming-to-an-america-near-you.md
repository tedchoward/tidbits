America… What a country! In America, you watch TV. In Soviet Russia, TV watches you!

The MPAA is trying to push a bill through Congress that would require anyone with a home theater to register with them. The home theater equipment will have devices that can determine information about the audience watching and report back to the <strike>KGB</strike> MPAA.

What makes a home theater? According to the MPAA, a home theater is any home with:

*   A television larger than 29″ with stereo sound
*   At least 2 comfortable chairs or a couch or futon

Here’s the magic quote from the article:

> “Just because you buy a DVD to watch at home doesn’t give you the right to invite friends over to watch it too. That’s a violation of copyright and denies us the revenue that would be generated from DVD sales to your friends,” said [MPAA head] Glickman. “Ideally we expect each viewer to have their own copy of the DVD, but we realize that isn’t always feasible. The registration fee is a fair compromise.

Pay attention to the government! They obviously don’t trust you, why should you trust them?
