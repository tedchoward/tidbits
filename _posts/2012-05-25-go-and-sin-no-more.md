Speaking of [not fearing we are reading the Bible wrong][1], Richard
Beck calls into question the moral standards of Jesus:
> Let's say [John 8.1-11][2] really isn't a part of the Bible as certain
> evidence might suggest. Let's say that Jesus never said "Go and sin no
> more." Imagine those words aren't in the Bible. Then ask yourself
> this: is there anywhere else in the gospels where Jesus says anything
> similar?
