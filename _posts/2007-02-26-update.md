Well, its apparently been over 2 months since I last posted anything to the ol’ blog.  The last think I wrote about was the late night release of ThinWire 1.2 RC 1.  So much has happened since then.  Instead of writing about everything, I’ll just list stuff that’s happened since then:

*   Two snapshot releases of ThinWire have been made.
*   I attended three weddings in three cities in three weeks.
*   I finished reading Asimov’s Foundation novels.
*   I attended a midnight wedding.
*   My printer broke.
*   Megan and I celebrated one year of marriage.
*   I purchased an iPod.
*   Epson sent me a brand new printer.
*   I read the New Testament
*   My company purchased additional office space.
*   I replaced the brake pads on my car.

Here’s what I haven’t done since the release of RC1:

*   Get a haircut.

See you in April!
