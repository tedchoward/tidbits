I don’t know why I do the things I do.  Today I searched Google for a phrase that I used to say a lot: ”Sleepmode is the squidaud”  It was an inside joke of sorts.  Busta Rhymes often says “Flipmode is the Squidaud,” refering of course to his group. Some friends of mine hijacked that phrase and began using it to refer to a love of slumber.  Anyway, I digress.

The point is that I Googled ”sleepmode is the squidaud” and only got three results.  Two were from the previous version of TedCHoward.com, and one was from a blog that I apparantly had 4 years ago.  Using Google as the record, I am the only person to ever post the phrase “sleepmode is the squidaud” on the internet.  I’m not sure how I feel about that.
