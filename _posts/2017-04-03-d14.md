Jim Schutze, on the [upcomming city council election][1] for Dallas District 14:

> Wood's waffling on the [Trinity River] park plan is concerning, but I'm too
> embarrassed to offer it here as a serious argument for anything, because that
> would be just too East Dallas deep-in-the-weeds hillbilly, and nobody outside
> of District 14 would even get it.
>
> So let's say this. The city is on the very verge of a huge change, a
> generational turnover of power and culture. That's the hat. District 14 voters
> will have to make up their minds on that basis. And then we can cut each
> other's noses off -- that's the part we really live for anyway.
