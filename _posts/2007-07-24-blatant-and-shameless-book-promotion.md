Yesterday at OSCon, Prentice Hall [announced][1] the launch of the [Sourceforge Community Press][2].  It is a special line of eBooks (called Shortcuts) that feature open source projects and are written by the developers themselves.

It is my pleasure to announce that one of the four titles available at launch is the *ThinWire Handbook: A Guide to Creating Effective Ajax Applications*, co-authored by yours truly.  It is available now for the price of $12.99 as a [downloadable PDF][3], and it is also available through the [Safari Bookshelf][4].

In the book, [Josh Gertzen][5] and I provide an overview of the entire framework.  Our goal is to describe the essence of each piece that makes up the complete framework, as well as to document features that may not be obvious to most developers.  So, if you’re into that sort of thing, go <strike>pick up</strike> download a copy, and start learning the awesomeness that is [ThinWire][6].
