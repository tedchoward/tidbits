Waldo Jaquith:
> Further reflection revealed that it's quite impractical--nearly
> impossible--to make a cheeseburger from scratch. Tomatoes are in
> season in the late summer. Lettuce is in season in spring and fall.
> Large mammals are slaughtered in early winter. The process of making
> such a burger would take nearly a year, and would be wildly
> expensive--requiring a trio of cows--and demand many acres of land.
> There's just no sense in it.
