[Tim Bray][1]:
> I was walking along near these parts in early evening, and a very tall
> very thin very young black womn suddenly materialized at my elbow:
> "Excuse me, hey!" I averted my face reflexively and stepped out a bit
> and she said "Oh my god no I don't want anything, just do you know the

> this ordinary girl in a hurry but lost. I told her the way and managed
> a smile, even though I hated myself.

Reading this upset me because I could see myself doing the exact same
thing. I attribute this to fear. Fear of what, I'm not sure, but fear
keeps me from looking at people, helps me keep my distance, prevents me
from getting involved.

I'm reminded of these words from [1 John 4.18][2]:
> There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear

My experience suggests that the opposite is also true: fear can keep
love out. Why am I afraid? What am I afraid of? I don't know, but I do
know that it is my fear that casuses me to judge.

I wonder if that was true of Simon, the Pharisee that Jesus visited in
[Luke 7.36-50][3]. A woman shows up at the meal and begins
crying and washes Jesus' feet with her tears. Simon is quick to note
that the woman is a sinner and is offended that Jesus is allowing this
action to take place. Jesus takes the opportunity to tell Simon a story,
but what gets me the most is the comment Jesus makes after he concludes
his story.

> Then turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, "Do you see this
> woman?"

Simon 'saw' the woman the same way Tim Bray first 'saw' the lost girl in San
Francisco and the same way I 'see' most strangers on the street.

Yet again, I find I have more in common with the Pharisees than Jesus. What am
I so afraid of? What will happen if I actually *look* at the people I
pass? How much love am I keeping out as I cling to my fear?
