Today is Election day across the country. Here in Texas, we’re not electing any high profile offices like Congressman, Senator, Governor, etc. As a result, I fear most people don’t even realize there is an election today. It has been my opinion for some time now that these “smaller” and more local elections are really the more important ones to participate in, because they usually involve issues that closer impact our daily lives.

Today’s election is no exception. On the ballot today are 11 proposals for ammendments to the Texas state constitution. These are the result of the most recent legislative session down in Austin this past spring. As my final effort to encourage you to go vote today, I will share how I voted this morning, and why I voted that way.



### Proposition 1

*   *The constitutional amendment authorizing the financing … of the acqusition … of buffer area … adjacent to a military installation….*
*   I voted **NO** – this could lead to higher taxes and it feels a bit eminent domainy to me.

### Proposition 2

*   *The constitutional amendment authorizing the legislature to provide for the ad valorem taxation of a residence homestead soley on the basis of the property’s value as a residence homestead.*
*   I voted **YES** – This should prevent counties from using property tax to persuade someone to sell their home so that a mall (or stadium) can be built on that land.

### Propositiom 3

*   *The constitutional amendment providing for uniform standards and procedures for the appraisal of property for ad valorem tax purposes.*
*   I voted **NO** – I don’t like giving up local control.

### Proposition 4

*   *The constitutionl amendment establishing the national research university fund to enable emerging research universities … to achieve national prominence….*
*   After waivering back and forth, I voted **YES** – Texas only has two tier 1 schools (UT and A&M), we could use some more.

### Proposition 5

*   *The constitutional amendment authorizing … a single board of equalization for two or more adjoining appraisal entities….*
*   I voted **YES** – It sounds like it will help out smaller counties by allowing them to pool their resources.

### Proposition 6

*   *The constitutional amendment authorizing the Veterans Land Board to issue … bonds….*
*   I voted **NO** because I’m generally against more debt, and there are no time limits and no oversite on this authority.

### Proposition 7

*   *The constitutional amendment to allow an officer or enlisted member of the Texas State Guard … to hold civil offices.*
*   I voted **YES** – state employes can hold office in other military branches, why not state militia?

### Proposition 8

*   *The contstitutional amendment authorizing the state to contribute money, property and other resources for the establishment, maintenance and operation of veterans’ hospitals in this state.*
*   I voted **NO** – While I do believe in caring for our veterans, I don’t believe in partnerships with the federal government that can cause us problems down the line.

### Proposition 9

*   *The constitutional amendment to protect the right of the public … to access and use the public beaches bordering the seaward shore of the Gulf of Mexico.*
*   I voted **NO** – It sounds nice until you realize that as the shore erodes away due to hurricanes and such, the public beaches start extending into private property which would simply be claimed by the state with no compensation. Worse than eminent domain!

### Proposition 10

*   *The constitutional amendment to provide that elected members of the governing boards of emergency service districts may serve terms not to exceed four years.*
*   I voted **YES** – The limit is currently two years. I’d rather these guys be doing their job than campaining for another term.

### Proposition 11

*   *The constitutional amendment to prohibit the taking, damaging, or destroying of private property for public use ….*
*   I voted **YES** – This strengthens the ban on taking private property for economic development.
