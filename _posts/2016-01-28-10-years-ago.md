Ten years ago today:

- I carried a Samsung flip phone
- My primary computer was a Windows PC
- I had a full beard
- I owed over $50k in debt
- My website looked like this: ![tedchoward.com in 2006](/images/2016/01/28/tedchoward_com_2006.png)
- I began the day a single man.


Ten years later, things are unquestionably much better. Yes, I like my iPhone
and MacBook, it's nice to be clean-shaven, it's wonderful to be debt-free, and
<s>my site design skills have improved</s> I still have a website. But the one
thing that unquestionably made me into a better person is being married to the
woman that, ten years ago, drove me wild.

I met her 21 years ago. I fell in love with her 11 years ago. Over the past ten
years, I have learned what it means to truly love someone. Together we have
dreamed, we have worked, we have grown. Together we survived graduate
school and a startup. With gazelle intensity, we became debt-free and laid the
foundation that allowed us to own the home we live in today. Together we
wrestled with our faith and what it truly means to follow Jesus in this world.
Together we are raising two beautiful boys.

Looking back, I wouldn't want to have lived my life with anyone else. Looking
forward, I'm still just as excited and thrilled as I was ten years ago at the
prospect of spending the rest of my life with her.

Happy anniversary Megan! I love you.
