I’ve been a subscriber of [Blockbuster Online][1] for over two years now. At the start of this year, they raised their rate by $2 a month and limited the number of in store exchanges to 2 per month. What pushed me over the edge was the fact that they automatically published the movies I requested to my Facebook feed. I never authorized this, I never linked the accounts. In fact, I use different email addresses for those services, so they had to do some browser magic or something to accomplish this. To me, this is a violation.

So, the question is, do I switch to [Netflix][2]. Their plan for one at a time is $8.99, but there is obviously no in store rental. Instead they offer a selection of films that I can watch online. The problem is, that service is Windows only, and I’m on a Mac. (I’ve heard it does work in Parallels). Blockbuser offers a no store exchange plan at $8.99 as well.

Any thoughts? Any positive/negative experiences with either service?
