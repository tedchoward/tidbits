I had an idea for a short micro post, went to my Mac to write it.

20 minutes later, after fixing an issue with `rbenv`, separating micro-posts from full posts, fixing the build system, etc. I've forgotten what I was going to post.

Perhaps my blogging system is too complex.

Perhaps I would blog more if there wasn't so much friction.
