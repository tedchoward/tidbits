I don't like national elections. Don't get me wrong, I believe in and
understand their importance. In fact, I think it's great that every
citizen gets a vote in choosing national leaders. The problem I have
with national elections is that it over-inflates the importance of our
national leaders. They trick us into putting our hopes and dreams into
one candidate. The one candidate who has all the answers for the
economy, military, society, etc. It's easy to get caught up in this
contest, even if you try not to.

It happened to me this year. I didn't like either candidate. I felt
neither one of them represented me, so I checked out. I voted, but did
so almost begrudgingly.

**I began to believe the lie that I had no influence in this world.**

The truth is, every one of has influence. Influence works like a radio
signal. It's strongest when your right next to the tower, and the
further away you get, the weaker the signal gets.

I have the most influence on those closest to me: my family, my
friends, my coworkers, my neighbors. I have the least influence on those
I see or speak with rarely.

What am I doing with this influence?

**When you believe the lie that you have no influence, you absolve
yourself from any responsibility to this world and those around you.**
Once you accept the truth (that you have influence), you must also
accept the responsibility.

I want to spend some more time unpacking this concept, but first I think
we need to live with these questions:

1. What is the scope of your influence?
2. What should you do with it?
