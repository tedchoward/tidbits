The State Fair of Texas:
> Fair visitors spent more than $35 million on food and amusement rides. This
> amount, which represents revenue from coupon sales (State Fair currency for
> food and rides) was slightly less than last year's all-time high of $37
> million.

Once again, the Fair has come and gone.  Next year's Fair will start on
Friday, September 28, 2012.
