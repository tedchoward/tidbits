The New York Times has yet another [story][1] on scientists attacking religion and vice versa. Does it make me foolish to believe that faith in God and scientific truth are in harmony with each other and not polar opposites? It would be nice to be able to believe in things proven by observation without being labeled a heretic, and likewise, I would enjoy discussing my faith in God without being labeled an idiot.
