Last night my wife was enrolling in her university’s health insurance plan.  The insurance company’s website committed one of my biggest web development pet peeves: using a Java applet for a navigation menu.  This brings up my question: when is it appropriate to use a Java applet on your web site?  I’d appreciate your responses in the comments thread.

(As a side note, it was also very poorly implemented.  I got an error saying that I needed to make sure Java was installed for Internet Explorer on my version of Windows.  We were using Safari on the Mac!!)
