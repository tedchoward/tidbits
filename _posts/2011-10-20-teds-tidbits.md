### The voice in my head says: ###
> Another blog?  Really?  Don't you have enough of these already?

The real answer, is that I have too many of these and I need to
consolidate.  When I post something online, it's usually either a link
to something I found interesting or it's a full page blog post that's
been gestating in my brain for a while.  Up until now, I've had two
separate avenues for publishing this content.  Links went to my
[linkblog][1] (and from there to [Twitter][2] and Facebook).  Full posts
went to my [blog][3] (often with a link to the post being added to the
linkblog).

I rarely post full posts, most of the stuff I post are links to other
sites.  The linkblog is great, but it has one flaw: there's just not a
good place to add my commentary.  This is important because often I will
want to share a link that I do not agree with, but find interesting.
When you post a link to Twitter, it's implied that you like and agree
with what you've just linked to.  I really want some space (more than
140 charaters minus the url) to add my 2 cents.

This blog represents the combination of the full blog and link blog.
Most posts will be just a link to something else with a quote and some
comments.  Nothing more.  Occasionally I'll hop up here and ramble for
a full page, but that doesn't happen too often.

### What's with the name? ###

When I was in kindergarten, I published a newsletter called Ted's
Tidbits and passed it out to my classmates.  (Actually I'm pretty sure
my Dad did most of the work on this one.)  I don't remember much about
that except for what it looked like and the name.  Considering I'm
really just commenting on what I find as I read the internet, I think
the name fits this format perfectly.

Like everything else I've done online, this is an experiment.  We'll see
how well that goes.

Oh yeah, I definitely ripped off [daringfireball.net][4] with this site.
