I am more and more of the opinion that opinionated reporting is more
honest than "impartial" reporting. I don't believe that one can truly be
impartial and that anyone who claims to be is not being honest.

If someone has spent a lifetime covering an industry or topic or company
or whatever, that makes them something of an expert on the subject.
Someone whose opinion we should value.
