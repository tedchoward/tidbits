Jason Heid collects some choice quotes from various national media
outlets discussing last night's episode of *Top Chef: Texas* which was
filmed in Dallas.  It's a wonderful collection of gems such as
> What we learned here is that rich people in Dallas are freaking weird.

Thank you Bravo, for bringing this wonderful attention to my beloved
city.
