The [State Fair of Texa][2]s starts today, and I’m very excited! The State Fair is a family tradition for us, and so we go early and go often.

This year, we’ve decided to take our combined 160 years of fair-going experience and share it. If you want to learn how to visit the Fair like the Howards, make sure you follow [http://howardguide.com][3]. We’ll be posting our tips and reviews on all things State Fair of Texas.

Now, I’m off to the Fair!
