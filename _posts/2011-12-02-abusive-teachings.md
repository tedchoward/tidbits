I'm about to become a parent, so I've been reading as much on the
subject as I can. Just about all the authors disagree with each other on
some points, so I'm reading to backfill my mind so I can come up with my
own style. I like parts of almost everything I've read, but every once
in a while I see something that is just shocking.
