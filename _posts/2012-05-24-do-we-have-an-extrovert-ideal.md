RJS:
> The megachurch culture, worship form, and values sets up an
> extroverted atmosphere. Leaders must be extroverts, there is little
> place for contemplation, conversation (not small talk - real
> conversation), and deep thinking. Everything is smiles and
> pleasantries and generalities with a vague avoidance of anything that
> may get too familiar.
